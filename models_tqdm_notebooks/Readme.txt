In this folder, You find for every visual representation (spectrogram), a notebook that 
allows you to test the different approaches proposed, mainly:  VGG16 transfer learning,
VGG16+SVM, 2layers and 3 Layers CNN architectures. Moreover, for Mel-spectrogram,
you find tested time, frequency, time/frequency models. 

All models in this section use datasets generated with tqdm library and not ImageGenerator. 
The difference between the two is negligeable, however the structure of the code may differ in 
certain parts.

* Since all tests for these codes were tested on Google colab, their results were saved on google drive.
